## 1. Architecture Overview

### 1.1 Multi-Database Strategy

The Client Management System employs a multi-database architecture to separate concerns and optimize performance. Three primary databases serve distinct purposes within the platform.

**Customer Database** (`insightserenity_customer_dev` / `insightserenity_customer_prod`) contains all customer-facing business entities including clients, contacts, documents, notes, users, and organizations. This database experiences the highest transaction volume and contains the majority of business data. Isolation in a dedicated database enables independent scaling and backup strategies.

**Shared Database** (`insightserenity_shared_dev` / `insightserenity_shared_prod`) stores cross-tenant shared resources including configuration settings, token blacklists, and system-wide reference data. This database has lower transaction volume but requires high availability as it supports authentication and authorization for all tenants.

**Admin Database** (`insightserenity_admin_dev` / `insightserenity_admin_prod`) houses platform administration data including system users, billing information, and platform-level analytics. Administrative operations are segregated to prevent interference with customer operations and enable separate security policies.

### 1.2 Connection Architecture

The application maintains persistent connections to all three databases through a connection pooling mechanism. Connection pools are configured with appropriate sizes based on expected concurrent operations. The customer database connection pool is largest due to high transaction volume, while admin database pool is smaller reflecting lower operational frequency.

Database connections are established during application startup with retry logic and exponential backoff to handle temporary connectivity issues. Health checks continuously monitor connection status and trigger reconnection attempts when failures are detected. Connection failure isolation prevents cascading failures across databases - failure in admin database does not impact customer database operations.

MongoDB connection URIs use DNS SRV records for Atlas deployments, enabling automatic server discovery and failover. Connection strings include authentication credentials, SSL/TLS configuration, and connection options like retry writes and write concern. Production environments use certificate pinning for additional security.

### 1.3 Tenant Isolation

Every document in multi-tenant collections includes a tenantId field that partitions data by tenant. Application-level enforcement adds tenantId filters to all queries automatically, preventing accidental cross-tenant data access. Database indexes include tenantId as prefix to optimize tenant-specific queries.

Tenant isolation provides security through data segregation while enabling efficient resource sharing. Single database instance serves multiple tenants with proper isolation guarantees. This approach balances security, cost-efficiency, and operational complexity compared to database-per-tenant or schema-per-tenant alternatives.

Physical data isolation for sensitive tenants can be implemented through database sharding with tenant-based shard keys. This places specific tenants' data on dedicated shards while maintaining single application codebase. Shard key selection considers tenant distribution and query patterns to avoid hot spots.

## 2. Database Structure

### 2.1 Customer Database Collections

The customer database contains eleven primary collections organized by functional domain.

**Client Management Collections:**

`clients` - Primary client records with comprehensive business information, relationship tracking, and analytics. Expected size: 100K-10M documents depending on platform scale. Average document size: 15KB. Growth rate: Thousands of new clients monthly in active deployments.

`clientcontacts` - Individual contacts within client organizations. Ratio typically 3-10 contacts per client. Expected size: 300K-100M documents. Average document size: 5KB. High read volume for contact lookups and engagement tracking.

`clientdocuments` - Document metadata and versioning information. File storage separate from database. Expected size: 1M-50M documents. Average document size: 8KB including version history. Write-heavy during document upload periods.

`clientnotes` - Activity notes and interaction records. Expected size: 500K-100M documents. Average document size: 3KB. Highest write volume of client collections due to frequent activity logging.

**User Management Collections:**

`users` - User accounts with authentication, preferences, and activity tracking. Expected size: 200K-20M documents. Average document size: 12KB. Critical for authentication performance requiring optimized indexes.

`userpreferences` - User-specific configuration and settings. One-to-one relationship with users. Expected size matches user count. Average document size: 2KB. High read frequency during session initialization.

`userprofiles` - Extended user profile information. One-to-one relationship with users. Expected size matches user count. Average document size: 4KB. Moderate read frequency for profile displays.

`usersettings` - Application settings and customization. One-to-one relationship with users. Expected size matches user count. Average document size: 3KB. Read during application initialization, infrequent writes.

**Organization Collections:**

`organizations` - Organization and tenant management. Expected size: 1K-100K documents. Average document size: 10KB. Low transaction volume but critical for authorization and multi-tenancy.

### 2.2 Shared Database Collections

The shared database contains system-wide resources accessed by all tenants.

`sharedconfig` - Platform configuration and feature flags. Expected size: 100-1K documents. Average document size: 5KB. High read frequency, low write frequency. Cached aggressively for performance.

`tokenblacklist` - Revoked JWT tokens tracked until expiration. Expected size: 10K-1M documents depending on user activity. Average document size: 500 bytes. High write volume during logouts, moderate read volume during authentication. TTL index automatically removes expired entries.

### 2.3 Admin Database Collections

The admin database stores platform management data with restricted access.

Collections include administrative users, billing records, platform analytics, system audit logs, and operational metrics. Access restricted to platform administrators through separate authentication. Lower transaction volume compared to customer database but higher security requirements.

## 4. Index Strategy

### 4.1 Client Collection Indexes

Client collection indexes optimize common query patterns and enforce uniqueness constraints.

**Primary Indexes:**

```javascript
// Unique client code per tenant
{ tenantId: 1, clientCode: 1 }     // unique: true

// Client lookup by ID and tenant
{ _id: 1, tenantId: 1 }

// Company name search within tenant
{ tenantId: 1, companyName: 1 }

// Relationship status filtering
{ tenantId: 1, 'relationship.status': 1 }

// Client tier filtering
{ tenantId: 1, 'relationship.tier': 1 }

// Account manager filtering
{ tenantId: 1, 'relationship.accountManager': 1 }

// Revenue sorting
{ tenantId: 1, 'analytics.lifetime.totalRevenue': -1 }

// Recent clients
{ tenantId: 1, createdAt: -1 }

// Soft delete filtering
{ tenantId: 1, isDeleted: 1 }

// User association lookup
{ tenantId: 1, userId: 1 }
```

**Text Search Index:**

```javascript
{
  companyName: 'text',
  legalName: 'text',
  tradingName: 'text',
  'contacts.primary.name': 'text'
}
```

**Search Token Index:**

```javascript
{ tenantId: 1, searchTokens: 1 }
```

### 4.2 ClientContact Collection Indexes

Contact collection indexes optimize contact lookups and engagement queries.

**Primary Indexes:**

```javascript
// Unique contact ID per tenant
{ tenantId: 1, contactId: 1 }      // unique: true

// Contacts by client
{ tenantId: 1, clientId: 1 }

// Contact by email
{ tenantId: 1, 'professionalInfo.workEmail': 1 }

// Contact by role
{ tenantId: 1, 'role.primaryRole': 1 }

// Engagement scoring
{ tenantId: 1, 'engagement.score': -1 }

// Recent contacts
{ tenantId: 1, createdAt: -1 }
```

### 4.3 ClientDocument Collection Indexes

Document collection indexes support document retrieval and filtering.

**Primary Indexes:**

```javascript
// Unique document ID per tenant
{ tenantId: 1, documentId: 1 }     // unique: true

// Documents by client
{ tenantId: 1, clientId: 1 }

// Documents by project
{ tenantId: 1, projectId: 1 }

// Document type filtering
{ tenantId: 1, 'documentInfo.type': 1 }

// Document category filtering
{ tenantId: 1, 'documentInfo.category': 1 }

// Recent documents
{ tenantId: 1, createdAt: -1 }

// Document visibility
{ tenantId: 1, 'security.visibility': 1 }
```

### 4.4 ClientNote Collection Indexes

Note collection indexes enable efficient note retrieval and search.

**Primary Indexes:**

```javascript
// Unique note ID per tenant
{ tenantId: 1, noteId: 1 }         // unique: true

// Notes by client
{ tenantId: 1, clientId: 1 }

// Note type filtering
{ tenantId: 1, type: 1 }

// Note category filtering
{ tenantId: 1, category: 1 }

// Note priority filtering
{ tenantId: 1, priority: 1 }

// Recent notes
{ tenantId: 1, createdAt: -1 }

// Tag search
{ tenantId: 1, tags: 1 }

// Interaction date range
{ tenantId: 1, 'interaction.date': -1 }
```

### 4.5 Index Maintenance

Index monitoring tracks index usage statistics to identify unused indexes consuming resources. MongoDB provides index usage statistics showing operation count, since timestamp, and access patterns. Review usage statistics quarterly to identify candidates for removal.

Index rebuilding addresses fragmentation and updates statistics for query optimization. Schedule index rebuilds during maintenance windows for heavily-used indexes showing degraded performance. Monitor rebuild progress and impact on system resources.

Index creation for new query patterns follows testing in non-production environments to verify performance improvement and resource impact. Measure query execution time before and after index creation. Monitor index size and build time for capacity planning.

## 5. Multi-Tenancy Implementation

### 5.1 Tenant Isolation Patterns

Application-level tenant isolation adds tenantId filter to every query automatically through middleware. This approach provides strong isolation guarantees while enabling resource sharing. All database operations go through service layer that enforces tenant context.

Query middleware intercepts all database operations and injects tenant filter based on authenticated user context. This prevents accidental cross-tenant queries even if application code omits tenant filter. Middleware operates at database connection level providing system-wide enforcement.

Schema design includes tenantId as first field in compound indexes to optimize tenant-specific queries. MongoDB uses index prefixes efficiently when tenantId appears first. All queries become covered index queries or benefit from index-only scans when tenantId filtering is present.

### 5.2 Tenant Data Segregation

Logical segregation maintains all tenants' data in single collection with tenantId filtering. This approach simplifies operations, backup, and maintenance while providing adequate isolation for most use cases. Database-level security prevents direct access bypassing application.

Physical segregation through sharding places specific tenants on dedicated shards for enhanced isolation or performance. Shard key incorporates tenantId ensuring tenant data colocation on same shard. This enables dedicated resources for high-value tenants while maintaining single codebase.

Backup and restore procedures respect tenant boundaries enabling tenant-specific backup strategies. Critical tenants may receive more frequent backups or longer retention periods. Restore operations can target specific tenants without affecting others.

### 5.3 Cross-Tenant Queries

Rare cross-tenant operations like platform analytics require special handling. These operations execute with elevated privileges and explicit acknowledgment of cross-tenant access. Audit logging captures all cross-tenant operations with justification.

Aggregate operations across tenants use MongoDB aggregation pipeline with appropriate grouping by tenantId. Pipeline stages filter, transform, and aggregate data while maintaining tenant context. Results partition by tenant preventing information leakage.

Platform administration interfaces operate with cross-tenant visibility but require additional authentication and authorization. Administrative users have separate authentication domain and cannot access customer-facing applications with same credentials. This separation prevents privilege escalation.

---

## 6. Data Relationships

### 6.1 Client-Contact Relationship

Client-to-contact relationship is one-to-many with clientId reference in contact documents. Contacts belong to exactly one client preventing ambiguous relationships. Compound indexes on tenantId and clientId enable efficient contact retrieval for specific clients.

Orphan prevention ensures contact deletion when parent client is deleted. Soft delete cascade marks all related contacts as deleted when client is deleted. Hard delete cascade removes contact documents when client is permanently deleted. Application enforces referential integrity through service layer.

Contact aggregation in client queries uses MongoDB aggregation pipeline with $lookup stage to join contacts. This approach is more efficient than multiple queries for displaying client with contacts. Projection limits returned fields to necessary data reducing network transfer.

### 6.2 Client-Document Relationship

Client-to-document relationship is one-to-many with optional project association. Documents may relate to overall client relationship or specific projects. Compound indexes on tenantId, clientId, and projectId enable efficient document filtering.

Document storage separates file content from metadata. Document records contain storage path and download URL while actual files reside in object storage. This separation keeps database size manageable and enables efficient file serving through CDN.

Version history maintains array of previous versions within document record. This embedded approach keeps version history localized with document for atomic updates. Version array size limits prevent unbounded growth with configurable maximum versions retained.

### 6.3 Client-Note Relationship

Client-to-note relationship is one-to-many with optional contact association. Notes document client interactions and may reference specific contacts involved. Indexes on tenantId, clientId, and relatedContact enable efficient note retrieval.

Note categorization uses embedded arrays for tags enabling flexible organization. Users can filter notes by multiple tags using array query operators. Tag aggregation provides tag cloud functionality showing frequently used tags across client notes.

Task extraction from notes creates embedded task subdocuments within note record. This keeps tasks associated with originating note while enabling task-focused queries. Separate task collection could be implemented for complex task management requirements.

### 6.4 User-Client Relationship

User-to-client relationship links user accounts with client records. The userId field in client documents and clientId field in user documents create bidirectional references. This enables efficient navigation in either direction supporting both user-centric and client-centric views.

Relationship initialization occurs during user registration for client-type users. Transaction support ensures both user and client are created atomically preventing orphaned records. The ClientRegistrationStrategy prepares client data using user context ensuring consistency.

Relationship updates propagate changes as needed to maintain referential integrity. When user email changes, primary contact email in client record may update to match. Service layer coordinates updates across related entities maintaining consistency.

## 7. Transaction Management

### 7.1 ACID Transactions

MongoDB multi-document transactions provide ACID guarantees for operations spanning multiple documents or collections. The Client Management System uses transactions for operations requiring atomicity such as client registration creating both user and client documents.

Transaction sessions begin with explicit session creation and transaction start. Operations within transaction associate with session ensuring atomicity. Commit finalizes all changes atomically while abort rolls back all changes. Error handling ensures transaction cleanup even during failures.

Transaction timeout configuration prevents long-running transactions from blocking resources. Default timeout of thirty seconds balances operation completion time with resource impact. Complex operations may require increased timeout with careful monitoring of resource consumption.

### 7.2 Transaction Best Practices

Transaction scope should be minimized to essential operations requiring atomicity. Include only operations that must succeed or fail together. Separate independent operations into different transactions to reduce contention and improve throughput.

Transaction retries handle temporary failures from conflict or resource constraints. Implement exponential backoff for retry attempts with maximum retry count. Log transaction failures for monitoring and identifying systemic issues requiring investigation.

Transaction monitoring tracks success rate, failure reasons, active transaction count, and average duration. Alert on elevated failure rates or long-running transactions indicating performance issues. Review transaction patterns regularly to identify optimization opportunities.

### 7.3 Optimistic Concurrency

Optimistic concurrency control handles concurrent updates without locking. Documents include version field incremented on each update. Update operations specify expected version and fail if current version differs indicating concurrent modification.

Conflict resolution strategies vary by use case. Retry with refreshed data works for most updates where last write wins is acceptable. Manual conflict resolution may be necessary for complex updates requiring user input. Conflict logging captures frequency and patterns for optimization.

Version field implementation adds __v field automatically by Mongoose or requires explicit schema definition and management for native MongoDB operations. Increment version on every update and include in update conditions. Failed updates due to version mismatch return appropriate error for retry handling.

## 8. Performance Considerations

### 8.1 Query Optimization

Query execution plans reveal how MongoDB processes queries and identifies optimization opportunities. Use explain() method to analyze query plans examining index usage, documents scanned, and execution time. Target queries scanning many documents for optimization through indexing or query restructuring.

Index selection follows query patterns with most selective fields first in compound indexes. Equality filters belong before range filters for optimal index utilization. Sort fields should appear in index to avoid in-memory sorting. Monitor index statistics to verify actual usage matching expectations.

Query result limiting prevents excessive data transfer and processing. Always specify limits for list queries based on pagination requirements. Default limit prevents accidentally retrieving entire collections. Sort with limit uses top-k algorithm for efficiency avoiding full collection scan and sort.

### 8.2 Document Size Management

Document size impacts query performance, memory usage, and storage efficiency. Monitor average and maximum document sizes per collection. Embedded subdocuments and arrays contribute to document size growth over time. Consider document size limits and growth patterns when designing schemas.

Large array management uses strategies like limiting array size, archiving old entries, or separating into related collection. Contact lists, note arrays, and version histories can grow unbounded without limits. Implement maximum size limits with archival of excess entries to separate collection.

Document compression occurs automatically for MongoDB WiredTiger storage engine. Compression reduces storage size and I/O with minor CPU overhead. Compression ratio varies by data characteristics with text fields typically achieving good compression. Monitor storage metrics to verify compression effectiveness.

### 8.3 Connection Pool Optimization

Connection pool sizing balances resource efficiency with adequate capacity. Calculate appropriate pool size based on expected concurrent operations and application instance count. Too few connections cause queuing and increased response times. Too many connections waste memory and database resources.

Connection pool monitoring tracks active connections, available connections, waiting requests, and connection creation rate. High wait times indicate insufficient pool size. Low connection utilization suggests excessive pool size. Adjust pool size based on observed metrics and load testing.

Connection timeouts prevent indefinite waits for unavailable database. Configure appropriate timeouts for operations based on expected completion time. Short timeouts fail fast but may cause unnecessary failures for slow operations. Long timeouts delay error detection and recovery.

### 8.4 Caching Strategy

Application-level caching reduces database load by storing frequently accessed data in memory. Identify cacheable data with high read frequency and low change rate like configuration, reference data, and user permissions. Implement cache with appropriate expiration and invalidation strategy.

Query result caching stores query results indexed by query parameters. Subsequent identical queries return cached results avoiding database access. Cache expiration or invalidation occurs on data updates. Consider cache hit rate and memory consumption when implementing query caching.

Cache invalidation strategies include time-based expiration and event-based invalidation. Time-based expiration suits data with acceptable staleness window. Event-based invalidation provides fresher data but requires coordination between update and cache invalidation operations.

## 9. Data Migration

### 9.1 Schema Migration

Schema evolution adds, removes, or modifies fields in existing documents. MongoDB's flexible schema supports additive changes without migration. New fields can be added to schema definition and will appear in new documents while old documents gradually update through natural modification.

Breaking schema changes require migration scripts updating existing documents. Write migration scripts transforming document structure to new format. Test migrations thoroughly in non-production environments before production execution. Plan for migration rollback in case of issues.

Migration execution strategies include one-time bulk migration during maintenance window or incremental migration over time. Bulk migration completes quickly but requires downtime or read-only mode. Incremental migration avoids downtime but prolongs migration period with schema version handling complexity.

### 9.2 Data Transformation

Data transformation scripts modify existing data for corrections, enrichment, or format changes. Identify documents requiring transformation through queries matching criteria. Apply transformations using update operations with appropriate operators. Verify transformation results through sampling and validation queries.

Bulk write operations improve transformation performance for large datasets. Batch documents into appropriately sized groups and use bulkWrite operations. Monitor operation progress and handle errors gracefully. Log transformation details for audit and troubleshooting.

Validation after transformation confirms successful execution and data quality. Compare record counts before and after transformation. Verify sample documents contain expected values. Run data quality checks validating constraints and relationships.

### 9.3 Data Import/Export

Data export creates external representations of database contents for backup, analysis, or migration. Use mongodump for binary exports preserving full document structure including types. Use mongoexport for JSON or CSV exports suitable for human reading or third-party tools.

Data import loads external data into database from various sources. Use mongorestore for restoring mongodump exports. Use mongoimport for loading JSON or CSV files. Validate imported data integrity and completeness after import operations.

ETL pipelines orchestrate extract, transform, and load operations for complex data integration. Extract data from source systems, transform to target schema and format, load into database with validation. Implement error handling, logging, and monitoring for production ETL operations.

## 10. Backup Strategy

### 10.1 Backup Types

Full backups capture complete database state at point in time. Schedule full backups daily during low-activity periods to minimize performance impact. Store backups in geographically separate location from primary database. Retain full backups according to compliance and recovery requirements.

Incremental backups capture changes since last full or incremental backup. Implement incremental backups for large databases where full backups are time-consuming or resource-intensive. Chain incremental backups to recent full backup for restore operations. Balance incremental frequency with recovery time objectives.

Continuous backup using MongoDB Atlas or oplog replication provides point-in-time recovery capability. Continuous backup stores oplog entries enabling recovery to any point within retention window. This approach minimizes potential data loss in disaster scenarios.

### 10.2 Backup Verification

Backup validation confirms backup completeness and restorability. Regularly restore backups to test environment and verify data integrity. Automated validation scripts check backup file sizes, record counts, and sample data. Document validation procedures and findings.

Restoration testing exercises complete recovery procedures including data restoration, application connectivity, and functionality verification. Schedule regular restoration drills to maintain team familiarity with procedures. Update documentation based on restoration experience.

Backup monitoring tracks backup execution status, duration, size, and any errors or warnings. Alert on backup failures or unusual characteristics requiring investigation. Review backup metrics regularly to identify trends or issues.

### 10.3 Retention Policies

Backup retention periods balance recovery needs, compliance requirements, and storage costs. Implement retention tiers with different periods for different backup types. Recent backups retained for short periods to recover from recent issues. Historical backups retained longer for compliance or analysis.

Retention implementation uses automated cleanup scripts deleting backups older than retention period. Implement safeguards preventing accidental deletion of critical backups. Document retention policies and ensure stakeholder approval.

Legal hold prevents deletion of specific backups related to litigation, investigation, or regulatory requirement. Implement legal hold mechanism flagging backups exempted from normal retention policies. Document legal hold application and removal procedures.
