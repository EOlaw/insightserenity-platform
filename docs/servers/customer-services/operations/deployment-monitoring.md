## 1. System Requirements

### 1.1 Server Specifications

The Client Management System requires adequate server resources to handle expected workload and maintain acceptable response times. Minimum production specifications include four CPU cores to handle concurrent request processing, eight gigabytes of RAM for application and cache memory, fifty gigabytes of SSD storage for application files and logs, and reliable network connectivity with at least one hundred megabits per second bandwidth.

Recommended production specifications increase resources to eight CPU cores for improved concurrency, sixteen gigabytes of RAM for better caching and performance, one hundred gigabytes of SSD storage to accommodate growth, and one gigabit per second network bandwidth for optimal throughput. High availability deployments should implement redundant servers across multiple availability zones with load balancing to distribute traffic evenly and automatic failover to maintain service during outages.

### 1.2 Software Dependencies

The runtime environment requires Node.js version twenty-four point nine or higher to leverage latest features and performance improvements. MongoDB version seven point zero or higher provides necessary database functionality with transaction support and improved query performance. Redis version six point zero or higher serves as cache layer and session store when horizontal scaling is implemented.

Operating system support includes Linux distributions such as Ubuntu twenty-two point zero four LTS, CentOS Stream nine, and Amazon Linux two zero two three. Process management in production environments should use PM2 version five point three or higher for process clustering, automatic restarts, and log management. Reverse proxy configuration typically employs Nginx version one point twenty-four or higher for SSL termination, load balancing, and static file serving.

### 1.3 Network Requirements

The application server requires outbound access to MongoDB Atlas on port four three seven to seven zero for database connectivity with secure TLS encryption. Email service requires SMTP access on port five eight seven or four six five for transactional email delivery through configured email provider. API clients connect to the application server on port three zero zero one in development or port four four three in production through HTTPS protocol.

Internal service communication occurs on configured ports for service discovery, health checks, and inter-service messaging. Firewall rules should restrict database access to application servers only while allowing HTTP and HTTPS traffic from load balancers. Security groups in cloud environments should implement defense-in-depth principles with minimal exposure of internal services.

## 2. Deployment Procedures

### 2.1 Initial Deployment

Initial deployment begins with preparing the target environment by provisioning required servers, configuring network access, and installing base software dependencies. Clone the application repository from version control to deployment location using Git with appropriate branch for target environment. Install Node.js dependencies by running npm install with production flag to exclude development dependencies and reduce deployment size.

Environment configuration involves copying the example environment file and customizing values for target environment including database connection strings, API keys, and feature flags. Build steps may include transpilation of TypeScript if used, bundling of assets, and optimization of production code. Database initialization requires running migration scripts to create necessary collections and indexes, followed by optional seeding of reference data.

Application startup uses PM2 to launch the application with specified number of worker processes based on available CPU cores. Verify deployment by checking process status, reviewing application logs for startup errors, and testing health check endpoint. Configure Nginx or load balancer to route traffic to application instances with SSL certificate installation for HTTPS termination.

### 2.2 Deployment Checklist

Pre-deployment verification ensures all prerequisites are met before beginning deployment. This includes confirming database backups are current and verified, reviewing change documentation for planned modifications, validating test coverage and passing status for new code, and ensuring rollback procedures are documented and understood.

Deployment execution follows documented procedures with step-by-step verification. This involves stopping application gracefully to complete in-flight requests, backing up current application version for potential rollback, deploying new application code with dependency updates, running database migrations if schema changes are required, starting application with health check monitoring, and verifying functionality through smoke testing.

Post-deployment validation includes monitoring error rates and response times, checking log files for unexpected errors or warnings, verifying integration points with external services, confirming scheduled jobs and background workers are running, and updating deployment documentation with any deviations or issues encountered.

### 2.3 Rolling Update Strategy

Zero-downtime deployments use rolling updates to replace application instances gradually while maintaining service availability. Begin by deploying new version to single instance while keeping others running on previous version. Monitor new instance carefully for errors, performance degradation, or unexpected behavior during initial period.

If new instance operates normally, proceed to update additional instances one or two at a time depending on cluster size. Allow each updated instance to stabilize and handle traffic before proceeding to next update. This approach limits blast radius if issues occur with new version and provides opportunity to halt rollout if problems are detected.

Load balancer configuration should remove instances from rotation during update process and add them back only after health checks pass. Configure appropriate connection draining timeout to allow existing connections to complete before instance shutdown. Monitor overall system metrics during rollout to detect any capacity constraints or performance issues introduced by new version.

### 2.4 Rollback Procedures

Rollback capability provides critical safety net when deployments encounter issues requiring reversion to previous version. Prepare for potential rollback by maintaining previous version files in backup location and documenting current configuration state. Database rollback planning must consider whether schema changes can be reversed without data loss.

Execute rollback by stopping application instances running new version and reverting to previous version files. If database migrations were applied, determine whether rollback migration is available and safe to execute. In cases where database changes cannot be reversed, consider data migration approaches to maintain compatibility with previous application version.

Validate rollback success by confirming application starts correctly with previous version, verifying critical functionality through smoke testing, and monitoring error rates and performance metrics. Document rollback reason, steps taken, and any data implications for incident review and future prevention.

## 3. Configuration Management

### 3.1 Environment Variables

The system utilizes environment variables for configuration management to separate code from configuration and enable different settings per environment. Critical database configuration includes MongoDB connection URI with authentication credentials, database names for customer and shared databases, and connection pool settings for optimal resource usage.

Server configuration defines listening port, hostname binding, environment designation, and SSL certificate paths if HTTPS is terminated at application level. Authentication settings include JWT secret key for token signing and verification, access token expiration period, and refresh token expiration period. Service integration configuration provides API keys for external services, SMTP credentials for email delivery, and feature flags for conditional functionality.

Security configuration establishes encryption key for field-level encryption, allowed origins for CORS policy, rate limiting thresholds per endpoint, and session secret for cookie signing. Monitoring configuration includes logging level for different environments, external monitoring service credentials, and error tracking service integration keys.

### 3.2 Configuration Files

Environment-specific configuration files complement environment variables for complex structured settings. Development environment file contains permissive settings suitable for local development including verbose logging, disabled rate limiting, and local service endpoints. Production environment file implements strict security settings, optimized performance parameters, and production service endpoints.

Configuration validation occurs during application startup to detect missing or invalid settings before accepting traffic. Implement configuration schema validation using tools like Joi to ensure all required settings are present with correct types and formats. Log configuration errors clearly during startup and prevent application from starting with invalid configuration to avoid runtime failures.

Configuration change management should treat configuration files as code with version control tracking, peer review requirements, and deployment procedures. Document all configuration options with descriptions, valid values, default settings, and environment-specific considerations. Sensitive configuration values should never be committed to version control and should be managed through secure secrets management systems.

### 3.3 Feature Flags

Feature flags enable controlled rollout of new functionality and provide ability to disable features without code deployment. Implement feature flags for significant new features to allow gradual enablement for testing and validation. Configure feature flags at application level for global settings or at tenant level for customer-specific enablement.

Feature flag evaluation should occur early in request processing to minimize overhead and provide consistent behavior. Cache feature flag state when possible to avoid repeated database queries for flag status. Implement administrative interface for feature flag management to enable operations team to control flags without requiring developer intervention or code deployment.

Monitor feature flag usage to track adoption and identify opportunities for cleanup. Remove obsolete feature flags after features are fully rolled out and stable to prevent accumulation of technical debt. Document feature flags with purpose, expected behavior when enabled or disabled, and cleanup timeline.

## 4. Monitoring and Alerting

### 4.1 Application Monitoring

Comprehensive monitoring provides visibility into system health, performance, and resource utilization. Implement health check endpoint that validates critical dependencies including database connectivity, external service availability, and adequate disk space. Configure load balancer or orchestration platform to use health check for routing decisions and automatic recovery.

Application performance monitoring tracks request rates, response times, error rates, and resource consumption. Instrument key operations with timing measurements to identify performance bottlenecks and track improvements over time. Monitor database query performance to detect slow queries requiring optimization through indexing or query restructuring.

Log aggregation centralizes application logs for analysis and troubleshooting. Configure structured logging with consistent format including timestamp, log level, service name, request identifier, and contextual information. Forward logs to centralized logging service for retention, search, and analysis capabilities beyond local server storage.

### 4.2 Infrastructure Monitoring

Infrastructure monitoring tracks server resources including CPU utilization, memory consumption, disk space, and network throughput. Establish baseline metrics for normal operation to identify anomalies indicating issues. Monitor process health including application process count, restart frequency, and zombie or defunct processes.

Database monitoring observes connection pool utilization, query execution times, replication lag, and storage capacity. Track MongoDB-specific metrics including operation rates, lock percentages, and cache efficiency. Alert on database issues requiring immediate attention such as replication failures, excessive lock contention, or approaching storage limits.

Network monitoring measures bandwidth utilization, packet loss, connection errors, and latency to external services. Monitor SSL certificate expiration dates well in advance of expiration to prevent service disruptions. Track DNS resolution times and failures that could impact service availability.

### 4.3 Alert Configuration

Alert configuration balances notification of important issues with avoidance of alert fatigue from excessive notifications. Define alert thresholds based on historical performance data and acceptable service degradation levels. Implement alert escalation policies that begin with informational notifications and escalate to paging for critical issues requiring immediate response.

Critical alerts requiring immediate attention include application down or unreachable, database connectivity lost, error rate exceeding threshold, response time degradation beyond acceptable levels, and disk space below minimum threshold. Warning alerts for proactive attention include memory usage approaching limits, connection pool saturation, elevated error rates not yet critical, and upcoming certificate expirations.

Alert routing directs notifications to appropriate teams based on issue type and severity. Configure alert aggregation to group related issues and prevent notification storms during widespread incidents. Implement alert acknowledgment tracking to ensure issues receive attention and provide visibility into response status.

### 4.4 Key Performance Indicators

Track essential metrics that indicate system health and performance. API response time average should remain under two hundred milliseconds for optimal user experience. Ninety-fifth percentile response time provides insight into worst-case performance experienced by users. Monitor error rate as percentage of total requests with target below one percent for acceptable reliability.

Database query performance metrics include average query execution time, slow query count, and index hit ratio. Track connection pool utilization to ensure adequate connections are available without excessive overhead. Monitor cache hit rates for performance optimization opportunities through improved caching strategies.

Business metrics complement technical metrics by tracking user activity and system usage. Monitor active user count, API calls per minute, client creation rate, document upload volume, and search query patterns. These metrics inform capacity planning and identify usage trends requiring attention.

## 5. Performance Optimization

### 5.1 Database Optimization

Database performance directly impacts overall system responsiveness and requires ongoing attention. Ensure appropriate indexes exist for frequently queried fields including tenant ID, client code, created date, and relationship status. Monitor index usage statistics to identify unused indexes that consume storage and impact write performance without providing query benefits.

Query optimization begins with identifying slow queries through database profiling and log analysis. Analyze query execution plans to understand how MongoDB processes queries and identify opportunities for improvement through indexing or query restructuring. Avoid inefficient query patterns such as queries without indexed fields, unbounded queries without limits, and queries causing full collection scans.

Connection pooling configuration balances resource efficiency with adequate capacity for concurrent operations. Configure pool size based on expected concurrent database operations with consideration for connection overhead. Monitor connection pool metrics including active connections, waiting requests, and connection creation rate to validate configuration adequacy.

### 5.2 Application Performance

Application code optimization focuses on reducing processing overhead and improving throughput. Implement caching for frequently accessed data that changes infrequently such as configuration settings, reference data, and user permissions. Configure appropriate cache expiration policies to balance data freshness with performance benefits.

Asynchronous processing moves time-consuming operations off the request path to improve response times. Implement background job processing for tasks like email notifications, data exports, report generation, and external API calls. Use message queues to decouple producers from consumers and provide reliability through persistent message storage.

Code profiling identifies performance bottlenecks in application logic requiring optimization. Monitor hot paths through application to understand where execution time is spent. Optimize data structures and algorithms for frequently executed code paths while accepting less optimal approaches for infrequent operations.

### 5.3 Load Balancing

Load balancing distributes traffic across multiple application instances to improve capacity and reliability. Configure load balancer with appropriate algorithm such as round-robin for even distribution or least-connections for workload-aware routing. Implement health checks that verify application instance health before routing traffic to prevent requests to failed instances.

Session affinity considerations depend on session storage approach. Externalize session storage to Redis or database to eliminate need for sticky sessions and simplify load balancing. If sticky sessions are required, configure load balancer to route subsequent requests from same client to same application instance while implementing session replication as backup.

Connection draining during instance updates allows graceful handling of in-flight requests before instance shutdown. Configure appropriate timeout period based on typical request duration to avoid premature termination of long-running requests. Monitor connection draining effectiveness to validate timeout configuration adequacy.

## 6. Backup and Recovery

### 6.1 Backup Strategy

Comprehensive backup strategy protects against data loss from various failure scenarios including hardware failure, software bugs, malicious actions, and operational errors. Implement automated daily backups with retention period matching compliance requirements and recovery needs. Configure backup schedule during low-activity periods to minimize performance impact on production workload.

Backup scope includes complete database backup for customer and shared databases, application configuration files, uploaded document storage, and log files for audit purposes. Verify backup completeness and integrity through automated validation processes that check backup file sizes, record counts, and sample data restoration.

Off-site backup storage protects against site-wide disasters such as data center failures or regional outages. Configure backup replication to geographically separate location with appropriate retention policy. Implement backup encryption to protect sensitive data in backup files and during transit to backup storage.

### 6.2 Recovery Procedures

Recovery procedures provide step-by-step guidance for restoring service after various failure scenarios. Document recovery time objective representing maximum acceptable downtime and recovery point objective representing maximum acceptable data loss. These metrics guide backup frequency and recovery prioritization decisions.

Database recovery from backup involves stopping application to prevent conflicting updates, restoring database files from backup location, verifying data integrity through sample queries, and restarting application with health check monitoring. Practice recovery procedures regularly through scheduled drills to validate documentation accuracy and team familiarity.

Point-in-time recovery capability enables restoration to specific moment before incident occurred. MongoDB replica sets with oplog provide point-in-time recovery within oplog retention window. Document recovery commands and validation steps for different recovery scenarios including complete database loss, corrupted collections, and accidental data deletion.

### 6.3 Disaster Recovery

Disaster recovery planning addresses large-scale failures requiring failover to backup infrastructure. Define disaster scenarios including data center failures, regional outages, and catastrophic data loss. Document recovery procedures for each scenario with clear decision criteria for triggering disaster recovery processes.

Hot standby infrastructure maintains continuously updated replica in separate geographic region ready for immediate failover. Configure replication from primary to standby with monitoring of replication lag to ensure standby remains current. Test failover procedures regularly to validate readiness and identify configuration issues before actual emergency.

Cold standby approach maintains backup infrastructure that can be activated when needed but remains inactive during normal operations. This reduces ongoing costs while providing recovery capability with longer recovery time. Document activation procedures including resource provisioning, configuration deployment, and traffic redirection.

## 7. Security Operations

### 7.1 Access Control

Access control management ensures only authorized personnel can access production systems and sensitive data. Implement principle of least privilege by granting minimum permissions necessary for each role. Regular access reviews verify continued need for access and identify accounts requiring permission updates or deactivation.

Administrative access to production systems should require multi-factor authentication and be limited to authorized operations staff. Audit all administrative access with logging of commands executed, changes made, and user identity. Implement break-glass procedures for emergency access during authentication system failures with enhanced logging and review requirements.

Database access control restricts direct database access to minimize risk of unauthorized data access or modification. Applications connect using service accounts with permissions limited to required operations. Database administrators should access production databases only through jump hosts with session recording for audit purposes.

### 7.2 Security Patching

Security patch management maintains system security by promptly applying updates addressing discovered vulnerabilities. Subscribe to security advisories for all system components including operating system, Node.js runtime, application dependencies, and database software. Evaluate security patches for applicability and risk to prioritize deployment.

Critical security patches require expedited deployment outside normal release cycles when vulnerabilities present significant risk. Test patches in non-production environment before production deployment to identify potential compatibility issues. Coordinate patch deployment with application downtime requirements and communicate changes to stakeholders.

Dependency vulnerability scanning identifies security issues in application dependencies including direct dependencies and transitive dependencies. Configure automated scanning during development and deployment pipelines to detect vulnerabilities early. Prioritize remediation based on severity, exploitability, and exposure level.

### 7.3 Incident Response

Security incident response procedures guide team through detection, containment, eradication, and recovery from security events. Define incident classification criteria to determine appropriate response based on severity and scope. Establish communication protocols for incident notification, stakeholder updates, and post-incident reporting.

Incident detection relies on security monitoring, log analysis, and anomaly detection. Configure alerts for suspicious activities including unusual access patterns, failed authentication attempts, privilege escalation attempts, and data exfiltration indicators. Investigate alerts promptly to distinguish false positives from genuine security incidents.

Incident containment procedures isolate affected systems to prevent further damage while preserving evidence for investigation. Document containment actions including network isolation, account suspension, and service restriction. Coordinate with legal and compliance teams for incidents requiring regulatory notification or law enforcement involvement.

## 8. Troubleshooting

### 8.1 Common Issues

Application startup failures often result from configuration errors, database connectivity issues, or missing dependencies. Review application logs for error messages indicating root cause. Verify environment variables are properly set with correct values. Test database connectivity independently using MongoDB client tools. Confirm all required Node modules are installed by reviewing package.json dependencies against installed packages.

Performance degradation may result from database query inefficiency, memory leaks, or resource exhaustion. Monitor system resources including CPU, memory, and disk I/O to identify bottlenecks. Analyze slow query logs to identify queries requiring optimization. Review application memory usage patterns to detect memory leaks requiring code fixes.

Authentication failures indicate issues with JWT token generation or validation. Verify JWT secret configuration matches between token generation and validation. Check token expiration settings and client-side token storage. Review token blacklist functionality for properly expired tokens still accepted. Test authentication flow end-to-end with known-good credentials.

### 8.2 Diagnostic Tools

Log analysis provides primary troubleshooting tool for investigating issues. Configure structured logging with consistent format enabling parsing and analysis. Use log aggregation tools to search across multiple servers and time periods. Implement correlation IDs to track request flow through distributed systems.

Database profiling reveals query performance issues and helps identify optimization opportunities. Enable MongoDB profiling in targeted manner to avoid performance overhead from comprehensive profiling. Analyze profiler output to understand query execution patterns and resource consumption. Use explain functionality to understand query execution plans and index usage.

Network diagnostic tools troubleshoot connectivity issues between system components. Use ping and traceroute to verify network reachability and identify routing problems. Employ netstat or ss to examine active connections and listening ports. Use tcpdump or Wireshark to capture and analyze network traffic for protocol-level issues.

### 8.3 Error Investigation

Systematic error investigation begins with reproducing the issue in controlled environment when possible. Document steps to reproduce including inputs, environment state, and observable symptoms. Gather relevant information including error messages, stack traces, log entries, and system metrics.

Root cause analysis traces error back to underlying cause rather than superficial symptoms. Follow error trail through logs and stack traces to identify failure origin. Consider environmental factors, recent changes, and interaction with external systems. Test hypotheses through controlled experiments isolating potential causes.

Resolution validation confirms fix addresses root cause and prevents recurrence. Deploy fix to test environment and verify issue no longer occurs under previous failure conditions. Monitor production environment after deployment to confirm resolution effectiveness. Document issue details, investigation findings, and resolution for knowledge base.

### 8.4 Support Escalation

Tiered support model routes issues to appropriate expertise level. First-tier support handles common issues using documented procedures and runbooks. Second-tier support addresses complex technical issues requiring deeper system knowledge. Third-tier support involves development team for issues requiring code changes or architecture expertise.

Escalation criteria include issues beyond responder's knowledge or authority, problems requiring vendor support or third-party expertise, and incidents exceeding severity thresholds requiring senior attention. Document escalation paths with contact information and escalation triggers. Track escalated issues through resolution to ensure proper handoff and closure.

Issue documentation captures essential information for effective resolution. Include problem description, symptoms observed, steps to reproduce, environment details, troubleshooting steps attempted, and relevant log excerpts. Maintain issue tracking system with status updates and resolution documentation for knowledge sharing and trend analysis.

## 9. Maintenance Procedures

### 9.1 Routine Maintenance

Scheduled maintenance activities maintain system health and prevent issues. Weekly tasks include reviewing error logs for recurring issues, checking disk space usage and cleaning old log files, verifying backup completion and success, and reviewing security alerts and access logs. Monthly tasks include analyzing performance trends and identifying optimization opportunities, reviewing and updating documentation for accuracy, conducting security vulnerability scans, and evaluating system capacity against usage trends.

Quarterly maintenance involves comprehensive system review including architecture evaluation for evolving requirements, dependency updates for security and features, disaster recovery testing to validate procedures, and performance benchmarking to establish baseline metrics. Annual activities include comprehensive security audit, compliance review and certification renewal, capacity planning for upcoming year, and technology stack evaluation for currency.

Maintenance windows require coordination with stakeholders to minimize business impact. Schedule maintenance during low-usage periods when possible. Communicate maintenance schedule in advance with clear description of expected impact. Monitor system closely during and after maintenance activities to quickly detect and address issues.

### 9.2 Database Maintenance

Database maintenance ensures optimal performance and prevents issues from accumulating. Index maintenance includes reviewing index usage statistics, removing unused indexes, adding indexes for frequent queries, and rebuilding fragmented indexes. Collection statistics updates ensure query optimizer has current information for execution planning.

Data archival moves historical data to separate storage reducing active dataset size and improving query performance. Define archival criteria based on business requirements and access patterns. Implement archival process that maintains data integrity and provides access to archived data when needed. Monitor archival process effectiveness and adjust criteria as usage patterns change.

Database compaction reclaims disk space from deleted documents and defragments data files. Schedule compaction during maintenance windows due to resource impact and potential brief unavailability. Monitor storage metrics to determine compaction frequency requirements. Verify sufficient free space available for compaction operation before initiating.

### 9.3 Documentation Updates

Documentation maintenance ensures accuracy and usefulness of operational procedures. Review documentation after each incident or major change to incorporate lessons learned. Update configuration documentation when settings change. Refresh troubleshooting guides based on recent issues and resolutions.

Documentation review cycle should align with system change frequency. Critical documentation requires review after every significant change. Standard documentation needs quarterly review for accuracy. Reference documentation benefits from annual comprehensive review. Assign documentation ownership to ensure maintenance responsibility.

Documentation improvement focuses on clarity, completeness, and accessibility. Gather feedback from documentation users about unclear areas or missing information. Organize documentation logically with clear navigation. Include examples and diagrams to illustrate complex concepts. Maintain version history to track documentation evolution.
